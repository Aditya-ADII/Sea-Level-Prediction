# Sea-Level-Prediction
Jupyter Notebook Project: Predicting Global Sea Water Level with Gradient Descent and Linear Regression

Project Overview
In this Jupyter Notebook project, I aim to predict global sea water levels using gradient descent and linear regression. The project will focus on analyzing historical sea water level data and building a predictive model that can estimate future sea water levels based on the provided features.

Conclusion
As a conclusion of the predictive model, It can estimate global sea water levels using gradient descent and linear regression. The insights gained during data visualization and model evaluation will provide valuable information about sea water level trends and help us make informed predictions about future sea water levels.
